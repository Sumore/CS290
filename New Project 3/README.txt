Hey Joseph,

For context as to what I'm submitting here, I'm aware that they do not meet the complete requirement expectation for full credit submissions. 
As per my message on discord, these have been rushed out at the end of the term due to real-life events getting in the way. If they are not up to 
snuff, or they do not properly show my ability to do what is required to pass the class, I would not be overly suprised. If in you're opinion they 
are not enough to show literary enough to pass, so be it, and I will re-take this course at my earliest possible point. Or if you'd be willing I would 
make the effort to catch up any additional requirements over spring break to show that I have a grasp of the material. 

Let me know what you think when you get the chance to look over these. 

-Thanks,

Stephen
