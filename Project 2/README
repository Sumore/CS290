Assignment 2 (More HTML with CSS):

Again create a design for a web app that you would want to use!
Note: This can be a redesigned version of your first design.  I expect more details in these designs as we move forward.

Create a simple webpage (HTML can be simple, but include enough to show off your CSS styles) that attempts to apply some 
style from your design to the HTML; be sure to include at least the following CSS properties: class attribute, class selector, 
id attribute, id selector, role attribute, attribute selectors, font family, font size, font style, font variant, font weight, 
font property shorthand, text align, text decoration, line height, color (in a few ways), border and shorthand, padding and 
shorthand, margin and shorthand.



Although there aren't many changes to my inital design png, I believe the items being a bit more flushed out gave me ideas for how 
I could better organize the page. I know it's simplistic and doesn't do much, but this week I was more worried about practising how 
the pieces work together than modifying the code we wrote last week. In fact the table you'll notice is yours, however finding how to 
integrate it, size it, and modify the borders proved an interesting challenge. Once again the layout.png will be in with the main folder. 
I still can't get the visual embed to work in the README.

I'm hoping this is what you were looking for, the assignement this week seems much more open ended than last.
