    Create yet another design for a web app that you would want to useâ€¦ is this getting any easier yet?

Create a webpage with enough elements and styles that allow you to show off some JavaScript capabilities and include at least the following JavaScript features: 
input (perhaps using an input element), output (maybe inside a p or in a fancier element), variables of a few datatypes (at least number, string, boolean, and a couple objects), 
    show off some common errors and how you might avoid them, conditionals, repetition, arrays, functions, demonstrate scope, objects and events

Go find a JavaScript library that has some features that you think might be useful and be ready to discuss some of this with the class

Attempt to use that library to create another page that demonstrates some key features of the library (perhaps by going through a tutorial for that library?)</p>
