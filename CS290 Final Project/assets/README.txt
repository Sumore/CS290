Requirements:

Create a design and then attempt to implement it using as many of the elements, properties, and features of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
and server-side techniques that we have learned throughout the course.

    I got this idea while you were discussing using pokemon names for aliesses in a git-hub repo.I knew I wanted to keep this as simple 
    as possible, and knock it out quickly. I sat down to draw out a design, but my end drawing legitimately took the form of a square box 
    for an app inside a rectangular box of a webpage, I will include it, but it doesn't really have much info therin.

Demonstrate the following:

An understanding of design,

    Simple, but usable

structure (mostly HTML),

    The index.html contains the "bones" of the site

style (mostly CSS),

    style.css contains the visual modification elements

variables, conditionals, loops, and arrays,

code decomposition (functions, classes, and files),

    all these are contained in the script.js file, working the backend between client and server.

user IO and input validation,

    If I'm understanding these requirements the IO should be fufilled by the user interface of the responsive dropdowns, and the validation should 
    be shown via the event listeners constantly updating the "calc"

client-side components and server-side components,

    I suppose I'm confused on the terminology of this question. When I think of client side vs server side I think of the development process of both parts of the same whole. So 
    for instance here my .html and .css would be the client side, whereas my script.js file would encompass the more "backend" server side of things. Have I got this one turned around?

Consider using some web api, perhaps Google maps?


Now, go re-review each of the sites you picked at the start of the term, reviewing them now with your new knowledge of web development 
might make you notice more of some kinds of problems and make some of the problems less of a problem.  Be sure to include any thoughts 
you have on why your thoughts or opinions might have changed.

The 5 sites I cited were: 
    
    fandom.com/wiki (fanbase info websites) (Good)

        Although I still find these sites incredibly useful, and will continue to use these on a near daily basis I'm sure. I find myself 
        being a bit more nitpicky about the format of their pages. The design is rather simplistic, with the bulk of information contained 
        on each page just poured out without much formatting. I think some basic use of some additional dropdown menu's and hyperlink directory pages 
        could go a long way to cleaning up the overall design.

    Udemy.com (Video Lecture Courses) (Good)

        I've fallen out of favor with Udemy over the course of the term, less so for their design elements, and more for their hostile business model. 
        That being said once again while I find it still usable, it also now seems much more basic than it did before. They also have a problem with a 
        bulk of information being displayed without alot of orginization. 

    Login.linbenton.edu (linbenton Main Login for Moodle) (Poor)

        I continue to have to login twice, every time I attempt to gain access. Multiple times a day. It's insufferable, but I've become numb to that 
        little bug. Theres not much more to say about just the login interface. The single-signon is just a handle list of hyperlinks to bring you to 
        all the required sites associated for LB. A small grid of image hyperlinks is simple, approachable, and useful.

    Symbolab.com (Scientific Online Calulator) (Poor)

        Someone over at the symbo-lab tech department needs to learn the term "sticky". I swear just appending the initial insert box where you type 
        in the function you want worked on, and the end result while your scrolling trhough sometimes a page or two of decomposition, would save so 
        much back and forth by the user. 

    openvellum.ecollege.com (Mastering Physics) (Poor)

        Although I have since been made aware that the majority fault I had complained about with mastering physics, the due dates, had more to do with my
        instructor than the website. I found while working through the course material a prevaisive issue that the developers devoted one small section of each 
        page to be devoted to the visual elements needed to solve problems, with no way of increasing the size for closer inspection. I found myself consistantly 
        having to open thei mage in a new tab. including a link with each problem that gave the user acces to a full size verson of each visual element would just
        make the whole process easier.

Lastly, go review each of your own projects from the point of view of the aspects that you liked and disliked at the start of the term.

    I feel as though with the rushed nature of the majory of my submitted work projects 1-5 don't warrant much analysis. They were used to show proof of concept. However 
    I can say with complete honestly that this final submission is somthing that going forward I will accually use. The reason I chose this was while playing through Shield, 
    and eventually P.L.A. I found myself questioning type matchups consistantly. This is simple, lightweight, and will serve my purpose. I enjoy websites with very little 
    fluff, this is just that.
