Create a README file in your GitHub repo in a folder called assignment0 with the following:
(we will take a look at these sites again close to the end of the term!)

5 websites with aspects that you either like or dislike (such as good or poor layout, presentation of or overload 
of  information, easy or hard to navigate, loads quickly or slowly considering the data on the page, fun or frustrating, 
flashy or boring, cute or dreadful, great or poor interactivity, whatever else you might think of!),

a link to the site and what you like or dislike and ways that you think each of the 5 websites might be improved,



For this I'll be using examples from what I assume are relatively common website interfaces, however they are some 
of the most common I access, so it makes sense to have them be the focus of this query.

Website examples I liked:
  
  Spending alot of time playing games I find myself on "game".fandom.com/wiki pages alot in search of walkthroughs or hints to differant games. One of my favoriate niche 
  feature to these sites is their consistant layouts. There is always a bar with a search icon, and that search icon specifically searches the repository for the given
  game you are interested in. That level of data storage is impressive to me.
  
  just one of their many pages: 
  https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Terraria_Wiki
  
  Ever since my falling behind last term I've used Udemy alot to dip my toes into a variety of topics. In fact I have courses in HTML, JAVA, and C bookmarked depending on 
  where this class goes. One of my favorite small features of the site is that all of the lecture series have pop-up mouse over information panels when you're looking at 
  the directory. This way I dont have to spend 5 minutes of my time digging into the lecture page, and I can "at a glance" have a basic understanding of what the course 
  is all about. It's the little time saver aspects of websites like this that I appreciate.

Website examples I disliked:

  One of the most consistant software annoyances I have had over the last few years has come from LBCC single sign on. Every single time, 
  be it on my phone or on my pc I log in. I'm given the prompt:
  "Authentication Failed: Please try again. If you need help resetting 
  your password use the links below or try using a new window Here."
  After clicking the "here" hyperlink, and pressing sign in again with the same information, it logs me in. So I essential have had to log 
  in twice multiple times a day for years. It doesn't take long, but those seconds add up.

  Symbolab is an online function calculator that I have used quite a bit over the last few years of math, and has become a staple 
  on my chrome hotbar. One of the most obnoxious parts about the website( and I'm fully aware they do this to monotize their service)
  is that when you're attempting to see the step by step breakdown of a math problem, it will randomly propt you to either sign in with your
  paid account (which I have) or to sign up. There isn;t an initial prompt when arriving at the website, and once you do log in, there seems to be a common
  error where the problem you just entered is erased. It's frustrating to say the least.

  Another example of what I assume is just poor programming, is new software I've been introduced to this term called "mastering physics" which is a required 
  software for the PH201 class here at LBCC. The $75 service is just a simple question and answer interface, but the main UI when logging in is so bugggy it's 
  hard to determine what assigments are due on a given day. The weekly assignments are not shown when first arriving, you have to click on the individual days 
  when assignemtns are due on a calander to view them, then it occasionally takes multiple clicks or reloads to make the software accually run properly. I think
  the person managing the software probably has the same level of understanding of testing as I did last term.
